# Generic Type

This is a simple app aimed to improve phone typing speed.

## Game One

Game one shows random words from a dictionary and requires the user to type them in exactly. If a correct letter is entered, the letter turns green. If an incorrect letter is entered, the letter turns red. The user must type in as many words as they can before the timer runs out.

The length of the words depend on the difficulty selected. Each correct word gives the player 10 points. Every 5 words, the timer is reset and its speed is increased.

## Game Two

Game two shows the user a random passage from the book "The Brothers Karamsov" by Fydor Dostoyevksy. The passage scrolls up, its speed based on the difficulty selected. The user is required to type as much of the passage correctly as they can before the passage scrolls completely out of view. Again, correct letters are coloured green, and incorrect letters are coloured red.
